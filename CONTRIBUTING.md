# Contributing to Sinter

## Writing

All text in this repository uses Simplified Technical English
(ASD-STE100) in the style of Simple English Wikipedia. This style
applies to documentation, specifications, code comments, commit
messages, and the tool's own output. The rules:

- Write for the people who use Sinter or contribute to it. Assume
  they do not share your context.
- Use short sentences: one idea per sentence, about 20 words or
  fewer.
- Use the active voice and simple tenses.
- Use one word for one meaning, and use it the same way every time.
- Do not invent terms. When a technical term is necessary, define it
  at first use.
- Give every pronoun one clear referent. Repeat the noun when in
  doubt.
- Give the context before the detail, so that each sentence makes
  sense on its own.
- Use a numbered list for a sequence of steps.
- Use a table for facts that a reader can enumerate.
- Do not add notes that explain why a sentence or a file exists, or
  that restate what a reader can infer from the stated facts.
- Do not open a document with prose that explains what the document
  is, what it is not, or how a reader will use it. Start with the
  content.

We reproduce some text from elsewhere: license texts, the DCO, and
quoted standards. That text stays exactly as it is in the source.

## Build and check

Install [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) and an OCaml switch (5.1 or
newer). Then, from the repository root:

```
eval $(opam env)
opam install . --deps-only --with-test
dune build
dune test
dune fmt
```

Before you commit, check two things:

- `dune build @fmt` passes.
- `reuse lint` passes. Run it with `pipx run reuse lint`.

CI runs both checks.

## Licensing of contributions

Sinter uses two licenses:

- The code uses the Apache-2.0 license. See the LICENSE file.
- The specifications and the documentation use the CC-BY-4.0 license.
  See the LICENSE-SPEC file.

When you contribute, you agree to one condition: your contribution uses
the same license as the file that it changes. People call this model
"inbound = outbound". We do not use a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

## Developer Certificate of Origin

You must sign off every commit. Use `git commit -s`. This command adds a
`Signed-off-by:` line to the commit message. The line certifies that your
contribution satisfies the Developer Certificate of Origin. The DCO file
in this repository contains the full text. CI rejects commits that have
no sign-off.

## Changes written by agents

Coding agents write much of this codebase. We expect this practice and
we welcome it. The human who runs the agent signs off the commit. That
human is the contributor of record. When an agent wrote a large part of
a change, add a trailer to the commit message that names the agent. You
can use either of these two trailers:

- `Assisted-by: Claude Code` — the agent helped; the human is the
  author.
- `Co-Authored-By: Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>` — the agent is
  named as a co-author. GitHub shows co-authors next to the commit.

Both trailers keep the record of authorship in the git history. Do not
sign off code that you did not review.

## Third-party code

Do not copy code from other projects, unless both conditions below are
true:

1. The license of the code is compatible with Apache-2.0.
2. You add the code to THIRD_PARTY.md.

Never copy GPL or AGPL code into this repository.
